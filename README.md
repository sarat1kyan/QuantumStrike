# QuantumStrike
Automated Penetration Testing and AI-Enhanced Exploitation Framework
```
A New Era of Automated Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Exploitation
```
QuantumStrike is a groundbreaking CLI-based tool that redefines penetration testing by combining automated reconnaissance, intelligent analysis, and AI-powered insights. Built for speed, precision, and user experience, QuantumStrike handles everything from asset discovery to exploitation in one seamless workflow.

🚀 **Key Features**

 1. 🚩 _Intelligent Target Selection_
    
Choose your target type:
Server
Website
Network
Device (IoT, workstation, etc.)
Alternatively, scan an entire network to map all devices, services, and servers automatically.

 3. 🔍 _Automated Scanning & Tool Selection_
    
QuantumStrike intelligently selects the most effective tools (e.g., Nmap, Nikto, Shodan API) for the target.
Performs detailed scans to collect crucial reconnaissance data like:
Open ports and services.
Running software and versions.
Network topology and device details.
 
 4. 🛡️ Vulnerability Identification & Analysis

Analyzes scan results to identify:
Known vulnerabilities (CVE-based matching).
Misconfigurations.
Weak or default credentials.

 5. ⚔️ _Exploitation Options_
    
Option 1: Automatic Exploitation
Searches the internet and exploit databases for CVEs, payloads, and Metasploit modules.
Runs Metasploit modules or downloaded exploits automatically.
Option 2: AI-Enhanced Analysis
Sends the scan output to ChatGPT for:
Deeper vulnerability insights.
Recommendations for manual or advanced exploitation techniques.
 
 6. 🎨 _Stunning Command Line Interface_
 
A sleek, interactive CLI designed for simplicity and usability:
Dynamic prompts.
Progress bars.
Tabular results for clarity.

🌌 **Why QuantumStrike?**
🕒 Save Time: Automates tedious tasks like setting up tools and parsing scan results.
🎯 Smarter Results: Combines automation with AI for a comprehensive approach to penetration testing.
🤝 Collaboration Ready: Designed for security teams and solo practitioners alike.

Automatically collects detailed information about the target.

 3. _Analyze Vulnerabilities_
    
Matches findings with known vulnerabilities using CVE databases and APIs (e.g., Vulners, Shodan).
Prioritizes vulnerabilities based on severity and exploitability.

 5. _Choose Your Action_
 
Exploit Automatically:
Searches for ready-to-use payloads or Metasploit modules.
Executes payloads to confirm exploitability.
AI-Enhanced Analysis:
For deeper insights, QuantumStrike sends scan results to ChatGPT for advanced recommendations.

 6. _Generate Results_

Outputs actionable insights, clean reports, or even a proof of concept for successful exploits.
